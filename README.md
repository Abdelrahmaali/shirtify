# shirtify
Custom Shirt Design App


Shirtify is a web app that allows users to personalize shirts by selecting colors and logos. Built with React, Vite, and Three.js for dynamic 3D rendering, it provides a seamless customization experience. Valtio is used for efficient state management, while Tailwind CSS ensures a responsive design and Framer Motion adds smooth animations. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development and 3D graphics integration.
